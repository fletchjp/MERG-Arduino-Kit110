# MERG-Arduino-Kit110
 This is for test and example software for the MERG Kit 110 Arduino  shield
 
 These examples will have the Arduino pins configured to match the hardware of Kit 110.
 
 The user will also need to have a CBUS network.
 
## CANshield Release 1.2.1 FCU Version 2b
 
 This is an Arduino code to run to test the working of the Kit 110 shield once it has been built and connected to an Arduino UNO or NANO or MEGA, depending on the build choice.
 
 This code now detects the device in use and gives an message of the type detected.
 
 Further information will be found in a README file included with the CANshield example.
